# Guess-Game Prototype

This project is a functional prototype of a card-match game, developed as a technical assessment. The primary focus is on high-quality, optimized code rather than visual aesthetics.

Features

 * Smooth Gameplay: The game features fluid animations for card flipping and matching.
 * Continuous Card Selection: Players can select and flip cards continuously without having to wait for card comparison animations to complete.
 * Dynamic Layouts: Used Unity’s Grid Layout system to Supports various grid layouts (e.g., 2\times2, 2\times3, 5\times6). The cards automatically scale to fit the designated display area.

 * Scoring System: A scoring mechanism is implemented Matches count and Turn count.
 * Sound Effects: Basic sound effects are integrated for card flipping, matching, mismatching, and game over scenarios.
 * Cross-Platform: The game is designed to run on desktop and  Android
 * Quality Assurance: The application is free of crashes, errors, or warnings.
